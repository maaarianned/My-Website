        Quick hummus recipe This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. 
        It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. 
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
        It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

        <p><em>Hummus</em> that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food. 
        It deserves it.
        All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right.
        It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and <strong>olive oil in most traditional versions.</strong>
